    #### Tar package format description
    Tar package contains a total of **4** directories and **1** files, the directory introduction is as follows：

    - `images`: panorama image, the specific number is the same as the number of points
    - `materials`: 3D model texture map
    - ` model`: 3D model file
    - `screenshot`: Screenshot file, usually the cover image and title image

    The only file `work.json` is the metadata description information of the basic data of Rushi VR, the format refers to "Core Entity-Basic Data" chapter, the work.json under the dump is mainly stripped of the dependence on Rushi CDN

    #### Start uploading
    Recursively upload the above **4** directories to your own At the server side, you need to pay attention to two points：

    - Be sure to use **recursive upload** to ensure the original directory structure
    - The server can be your own business server, but in more cases it is still stored in `object storage`, generally Yes, object storage supports CDN acceleration to ensure a high-speed C-side browsing experience
