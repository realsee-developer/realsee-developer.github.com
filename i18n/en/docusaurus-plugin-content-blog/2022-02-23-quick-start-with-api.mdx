## Personal Food

[**like VR**](https://apps.apple.com/cn/app/id1502262095) is like a panoramic model taken by the official – you can simply take pictures using your phone instructions and generate VR live data after capture.

Generated VR data can be obtained by looking at the Open Platform's [**Open API**](/open/api/#/) , then using [**rendering engine Five**](/docs/front/3d-space/get-started/rendering-engine) you can build your own 3D application.

Just follow this text, quickly "not" the three-dimensional space capabilities you seek.

## 30 Minutes for Gathering Preview

:::tip hint
We assume you have basic knowledge of [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript) languages,[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/) and [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/) etc. If you are not in touch before, it is recommended to read this paper in a simple way.
:::

### Preparatory work

- Your machine has been installed in [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/).
- Your easy access to apple phone - for capting, capturing VR data.

### Capture Capture

First, you need to download [from the Apple App Store**like VR**](https://apps.apple.com/cn/app/id1502262095) - search in the App Store **"like VR"**.Sign up for an account by guide, then continue to work on the app：

- Do **"My Item"** loat **"Identity Select"** "Personal" **"Person"**(default).
- Tap the bottom bar **"+"** plus button to select **"phone beat"**(only iOS is supported temporarily.
- Once the project name is filled, click **"Create Project"** to enter the collection process.

Complete capture and upload by the App Action Guide, waiting for VR project processing (this process takes approximately minutes).

:::tip hint
suggests that you select a light indoor scene, such as picking your small bedroom during the day.
:::

Video tutorials are available for specific capture processes：<video style={{width: '100%'}} controls type="video/mp4" src="//vrlab-public.ljcdn.com//release//vrorion/\_\_\_2adb9edde32b9818c91e7475265aef17.MP4"></video>

### Get data

Once you have completed the capture and upload, you can get data by opening API [for example, by looking at](/open/api).You need to login to[before requesting data like the Open Platform Console](https://developers.realsee.com/console)— your account is just registered on the app.

Then click **"Apply Key"**to get your `Application Id` and `Application Secret`, which will be used to access the API interface for spatial data.

The API involved is：

- Authentication：`/auth/access_token`
- List data：`/open/v1/entity/vr/list`.
- Basic data：`/open/v1/entity/vr`.

:::tip prompts
to launch any API calls, get temporary `access_token`(default 5 minutes), and follow up requests.Businesses can consider setting up a cache for about three minutes to reduce the response time of the overall server API. For the specific initiation process, please refer to the source code [five-sdk-starter-with-api](https://github.com/realsee-developer/five-sdk-starter-with-api).

### Rendering VR

In order to save your cost of creating a scrap, you can also `git clone` [fuve-sdk-starter-with-api](https://github.com/realsee-developer/five-sdk-starter-with-api).

Enter the repository directory open `index.js`search`Your-App-Key` String replaced with the application`Application Id`, Search `Your-App-Secret` String replaced with the application `Application Secret`.

Finally, turn on your terminal：

```shell
cd five-sdk-starter-with-api
npm i
npm un start
# You will see console output, browser opens the link below and recommends using Chrome browser to ensure best experience
> node index.js
> serve at http:///127.0.0.1:3000
```

Go to [127.0.0.1:3000](http://127.0.0.1:3000) to experience your own VR space!

## Other Supplements

### Open Dataset

If you do not want to take a photograph, we also open [to the open source community**open-works**](https://github.com/realsee-developer/open-works) data sets for development, debugging, and research.

You can cross the capture and call open API process,[**Click here to quickly experience**](docs/front/3d-space/get-started/usage/00.space#效果展示) like the ability to render three-dimensional space.

### Enterprise Level Access

In addition to [**like VR**](https://apps.apple.com/cn/app/id1502262095) , provide powerful [**VR scanner devices**](https://realsee.cn/website/product/hardware) Gathering to generate realm three-dimensional space and [three-dimensional design tool](https://business.realsee.com/) create virtual three-dimensional space.
