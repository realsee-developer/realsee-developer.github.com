Like the Precious API, add an authentication process to ensure data security, such as when the Open Platform API requests access.The currently supported credit process includes an individual account

Parameter signature.The request parameter (Header/Body) is encoded by specific algorithms that include Unix timestamps as random factors (RANDOM FACTORS) to make data capture more difficult and secure the data.However, due to the complexity of algorithms, it is now temporarily abandoned to facilitate quick access/applications, which will be reopened when they are supported by the entire language SDK.The connected business party is unaffected access_token.When launching any API calls, get temporary access_token (default 5 minutes) first and subsequent requests are carried.Businesses can consider setting a cache of about 3min to reduce the response time of the overall server API
