desc: "Gets basic metadata for the current VR encoding (vr_code)."

:::tip
Basic metadata is available to render SDK, and can easily complete basic VR roaming features.

Corresponding to the front-end Quick Start[move to this](../../../front/3d-space/get-started/00.rendering-engine.md), it is not difficult for server engineers to run through the DEMO.

As there is a large number of data fields in the API, and as there is little need to understand direct passage, the details of the fields are not repeated here.
