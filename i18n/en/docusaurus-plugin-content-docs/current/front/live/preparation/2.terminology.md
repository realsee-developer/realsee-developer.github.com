## Frame data (Keyframe)

The collection of status data that the user interface needs to interact with the screen.

:::info
is usually displayed in key pairs - key is the name of the UI module, value is the status of the module.  
For example, frame data `{"popupPanel": { hidden: true }}` means that the interface has a popupPanel with a popup panel named `popupPanel` , it has `hidden` status,`true` indicates that it is hidden.
:::

## Snapshots (Snapshot)

Refers to the collection of all **frame data** at a time.

:::tip
You can understand that **frame data** is a subset of **snapshot** , and all states of the user interface at that moment can be restored through the "snapshot" information at a certain moment.
