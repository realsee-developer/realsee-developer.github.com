There are generally two scenarios for the display of the floor planï¼š**Radar map**when browsing the panorama of the house source (the left picture above), and **The detailed house plan map**when viewing the 3D model of the house house (the right picture above).

## Plugin Selection

If you want to display the household map in the Property Point Panorama scenario, you can use the[PanoFloorplanRadarPlugin] Panoramist radar image plugin with a similar effect to the left of the above graph.<br/>

There are currently two options for displaying theï¼šplan in the 3D model mode of the house.

- If you have more complex features and want to have more functional support, you can choose [ModelFloorplanPlugin] model household image plugins;
- If the scenario is simpler and wants quick access, you can choose [TopviewFloorplanPlugin] to view the household image plugin.
