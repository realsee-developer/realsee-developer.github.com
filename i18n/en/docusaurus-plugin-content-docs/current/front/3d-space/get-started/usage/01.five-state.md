title: Status Control
---

**Five** introduced the concept of **State** to facilitate understanding of the state of the current three-dimensional space.You can pass `five.state` to get the current state or call `five.setState()` to modify the state：

```ts
// Get the current model
five.state.mode;

// Panoramic Walking to
five.setState({ panoIndex: 0 });

// Switch the current pattern to "Floorplan" general view mode
five.setState({ mode: Five.Mode.Floorplan });
```

Here is an example showing the status value：of the current **Five** instance

### Data Structure

**State** is **Five** Render engine to describe the data structure of the current three-dimensional space state.It contains information such as **mode**of current space rendering, **collection point**,**camera direction** and **camera viewing angle**. Its data structure states the following：

```ts
interface State {
  mode: Mode /* view mode*/;
  panoIndex: number /* Gathering point or panorama point */;
  longitude: number /* Camera pitch */;
  latitude: number /* Camera deflection */;
  fov: number /* Camera visualizations (vertical) */;
  offset: THREE.Vector3 /* Camera Coordinate */;
}
```

### View Patterns

**Five** Built five view rendering **mode**, available through `Five.Mode` with enumeration：

- `Panorama`：**Panorama Walking Patterns** Performs Panorama Paths,**Fit to view pictures of collecting point place.**You can toggle the collection point by clicking on the screen or the ground "lead circle" and can rotate, zoom in both fingers, or select the right view for the wheel.
- `Floorplan`：**overview mode** view is centered on the model, and gesture operations can rotate/zoom in the model/switch floors,**is suitable for viewing the overall effect of the**.
- `Topview`：**Household Graphics Template** View is model-centric, vertical overpadding, gesture can shift/magnify models/switch floor,**is suitable for viewing model plane structure**.
- `Model`：**Modeling Models Mode** Views will travel freely in the model, gesture can rotate/amplify views/offset,**For viewing model details, make some location**.
- `VRPanorama`：**VR glasses model** can use [Cardboard glasses](https://arvr.google.com/cardboard/) or his third-party derivative to implement VR virtual display.

Each **view mode** plays a different role in different scenarios, where **Panorama** and **Floorplan** is most commonly used, but normally only follow these two patterns.No special settings,`five.load()` The default mode to render is **Panorama**.

You can switch mode by clicking the button in the top of the example above in order to compare the visual experience with different view patterns.

## Gathering Points

**Gathering point position** `panoIndex` refers to positions that can be set in `Panorama` and are commonly called **panorama position**Its location is reflected in **Work data** `work[observers]` and `work[panorama]` fields.

### How to understand collection point

In fact, the complete three-dimensional spatial information of the Scenario is processed by algorithms from the point information gathered.For example, the following video tutorial of [Realsee VR App](https://home.realsee.com/product/mobilecapture) camera acquisition - select a location (point) in space, then take a panoramic picture, collect spatial data such as depth, and then perform 3D reconstruction technology through Realsee cloud server based on these data Algorithm, and finally generate **Work data**for terminal rendering.

Normally we call the **panorama to walk** its essence in `Panorama` mode to change the position of the collection point.

## Camera description

**Five** is based on [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) with a three-dimensional model system identical to [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) with scene, renderer, camera etc.The interplay that we mentioned earlier does not change the position of the model in the three-dimensional space.In fact, we have done so by adjusting camera location information.

**The camera in Five** uses **Perspective**([PerspectiveCamera](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html?q=PerspectiveCamera#api/zh/cameras/PerspectiveCamera)) to make a projection.This projection model is used to simulate the sight of people and is the most popular projection mode used in the rendering of scenario 3D.

### `longitude` & `latitude`

**Perspective camera** concepts are complex and many parameters, as shown in figure I (left) above - not understood directly by modifying these parameters.

**Five** uses a pattern similar to **latitude** to describe the position of the camera, i.e. the horizontal corner of the camera, `longitude` and the position `latitude`in **radios**.

For example, we put the entire model scenario into a right-hand cartel coordinate, `XZ` plane parallel to the ground, `Y` axis perpendicular to the ground, as in figure I (right). The initial camera direction is the origin looking at **, the negative direction of the Z axis**, and the camera information can be affected by adjusting the latitude and longitude values：

- Add `longitude`：camera rotate left.
- Reduces `longitude`：camera rotation to right.
- Add `latitude`：camera rotate down.
- Decrease `latitude`：camera rotation.

### `fov`

The viewing angle of **in the vertical direction of the camera is**, that is, the value of `fov` in Figure 1 (left).The intuitive effect is to add `fov` the smaller the model shows, the smaller the `fov` the bigger the model.

### `offset`

The position of the current camera in the three-dimensional space is not recommended to change this value directly.

## Set Status

As already mentioned, the current state can be obtained by `five.state` by `five.setState() and by`method.

For example, switch to capture point in **Panorama** mode `0`：

```ts
five.setState({ panoIndex: 0 });
```

For example, set `latitude` to `0` to look at space：

```ts
five.setState({ latitude: 0 });
```

Of course, you can also bulk modify status：

```ts
five.setState({
  latitude: 0,
  panoIndex: 0,
  mode: Five.Mode.Panorama,
});
```

I believe that you have already modified the current state of the **Five** instance through the `five.setState()` method. If you are careful, you will find that `five.setState()` does not modify the current state value immediately, but gradually with animation Update to target state.If you want to disable animation transitions, you can set the second parameter `immediately` to `true` to reach target status now：

```ts
five.setState(state, true);
```

## `state` Distinction from `currentState`

Apart from `five.state` attributes **Five** provides `five.getCurrentState()` method to get the current state. In Static Scene, both ways get the same value, the difference is：

- **currentState** is the current state, the state that is rendered in the picture, the state that is currently shown.
- **state** is targeted or stable at the next time.

:::tip can be easily understood in this way:：
When **setState** is called,**state** will immediately become the value of **setState** , while **currentState** will not change immediately, it will be in the process of animation transition Gradually approach **state** and finally become the same value as **state**.When your animation time is not over, calling `five.getCurrentState()` has a high probability that the value obtained by `five.state` will be inconsistent.
