title: Event System
---

**Five** uses **publish subscriber mode** to manage internal asynchronous behavior, you can use `five.on()` or `five.once()` to monitor asynchronous events such as **Five** life cycle and interactive feedback.Of course, you can also unsubscribe from callback functions via `five.off()`.

:::tip
Full **Five** Asynchronous events you can view from [Five.EventCallback](https://unpkg.com/@realsee/five/docs/interfaces/five.EventCallback.html) , This is only a brief description of commonly used asynchronous events.

## Load Progress

From executing `five.load(work)` to rendering the 3D panorama and model mainly goes through four key stages：

**request cube panorama map** ➩ **request model map** ➩ **analyze 3D spatial data** ➩ **render 3D model**

### Panorama

In most scenarios, **Five** rendering default models is **Panorama**, allowing panorama to interact once six cube panorama maps are downloaded.

```ts
/* Your progress bar logic */
const progress = (pst: number) => {
  if (pst === 1) {
    five.off("textureLoading", progress);
  }
  const percentage = (pst * 0.75 + 0.2) * 100;
};
five.on("textureLoading", progress);

// The panorama has been rendered and can be interacted with at the current point
five.once("panoArrived", () => {});
```

::caution  
`five.on('textureLoading')` only indicates download progress of the panoramic picture, with `five.once('panoArrived')` There may be a delay of about 100 ms with full scope interaction.
:::

### Model Status

```ts
five.on("modelMaterialLoaded", () => {
  /* model material loaded */
});

five.on("modelGeometryLoaded", () => {
  /* model triangle data loaded */
});

five.on("modelLoaded", () => {
  /* model loaded */
});
```

## Status Change

As mentioned earlier, the **Five** state can be obtained and modified through the `five.setState()` and `five.state()` methods.

You can get `five.on('stateChange')` for **Five** status changes：

```ts
five.on("stateChange", (newState, oldState, userAction) => {});
```

:::caution
`userAction` indicates whether changes are made by users by clicking on, rotation, etc.
:::

### Panorama Walking

In`Panorama` **panorama walk mode** , you can walk in space (switch panorama position), there will also be some key events here：

```ts
five.on("wantsMoveToPano", (panoIndex) => {
  /* Intention to a certain point */

  return false; /* If the return value is false, the subsequent behavior will be aborted */
});

five.on("panoWillArrive", (panoIndex) => {
  /* ready to go to a certain point */
});

five.on("movingToPano", (panoIndex) => {
  /* going to a certain point Bit moving process */
});

five.on("panoArrived", (panoIndex) => {
  /* has reached a certain point */
});
```

### Mode switch

In addition to walking between points in the panoramic mode, there are also related events when switching between：.

```ts
five.on("wantsChangeMode", (mode: Mode, prevMode: Mode) => {
  /* will switch mode: 

can be blocked by returning false */
});

five.on("modeChange", (mode: Mode, prevMode: Mode) => {
  /* Mode, but the UI effects are not necessarily fully rendered in the new model, with an animation*/
});
```

You need to note that the inter-mode switch is attached and can listen to the animation execution event：

```ts
five.on("initAnimationWillStart", () => {
  /* Models toggle start */
});

five.on("initAnimationEnded", () => {
  /* Models tow end */
});
```

## Gesture action

```ts
// Gesture action
five.on(
  "gesture",
  (
    // GestureType: "pan" | "tap" | "pinch" | "press" | "mouseWheel"
    type: GestureTypes,
    // Multiple finger
    pointers: { delta?: number; x: number; y: number }[],
    // end of
    final: boolean
  ) => {}
);
```

### Slide Screen

```ts
five.on("wantsPanGesture", (pose: Pose, final: boolean) => {
  // Swipe the screen gesture is about to be triggered (not yet fired)
  // can be stopped by returning false for
});

five.n("panGesture", (pose: Pose, final: boolean) => {
  // Slide screen gestures triggered
});
```

### Click on the screen

```ts
// Below 250 ms
five.on(
  "wantsTapGesture",
  (
    raycaster: Raycaster,
    tapPosition: Vector2,
    duration: number,
    final: boolean
  ) => {
    /// Touch the screen gesture to be triggered (not yet fired)
    // can be stopped by returning false to prevent the trigger
  }
);

five.on(
  "tapGesture",
  (
    raycaster: Raycaster,
    tapPosition: Vector2,
    duration: number,
    final: boolean
  ) => {
    // Touch screen gesture to be triggered
  }
);
```

```ts
// More than 250 ms
five.on(
  "wantsPressGesture",
  (
    raycaster: Raycaster,
    tapPosition: Vector2,
    duration: number,
    final: boolean
  ) => {
    // Clicking the screen gesture will be triggered (not yet fired)
    // can be stopped by returning false to prevent trigger
  }
);

five.on(
  "pressGesture",
  (
    raycaster: Raycaster,
    tapPosition: Vector2,
    duration: number,
    final: boolean
  ) => {
    // Click on the screen to be triggered
  }
);
```

### Two finger zoom

```ts
five.on("wantsPinchGesture", (pose: Pose, final: boolean) => {
  // Two finger zoom gesture will be triggered (not yet fired)
  // can be stopped by returning false for
});

five.on("pinchGesture", (pose: Pose, final: boolean) => {
  // Two finger zoom gestures will be triggered (not yet fired)
  // Can be prevented from triggering by returning false
});
```

### Mouse Wheel

```ts
five.on("wantsMouseWheel", (delta: number, fov: number, final: boolean) => {
  // mouse wheel gesture will be triggered (not triggered yet)
  // trigger can be prevented by return false
});

five.on("mouseWheel", (delta: number, fov: number, final: boolean) => {
  // mouse wheel gesture is triggered
});
```

## Focus Circle

There is a focus circle inside the three-dimensional space, leading to the current mouse or touch screen area. The position and direction of the focus circle will be recalculated when moving gestures.

```ts
five.on(
  "intersectionOnModelUpdate",
  (
    intersection: Intersection, // focus collision detection result
    mesh: IntersectMeshInterface // focus ring
  ) => {
    // mouse focus ring position is recalculated
  }
);
```
