title: VR rendering failed
---

If your VR has been performing normally before, but suddenly the rendering fails at a certain moment, and the reason cannot be found out, please first troubleshoot from the following angles：

### 1, has changed domain name?

Check whether the `allow_hosts` field value in my `work.json` is consistent with the domain name configuration information in[console](https://developers.realsee.com/console).

### 2. Does the work data signature expire?

Check  `work.json` for the `expire_at` field to see if the signature expires.

e.g.： **"expire_at": "1964772839406"** , The browser console will [Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) timestamp `1964772839406` By `new Date()` method to [UTC](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date) time, See whether UTC time expired.

### 3. Modify work data manually?

:::warning
Please do not modify it manually `work` data, otherwise it will cause unpredictable rendering problems!
