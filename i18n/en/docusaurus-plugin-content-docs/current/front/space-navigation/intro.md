**Vreo** (VR Video) is based on a three-dimensional rendering engine [Five](https://unpkg.com/@realsee/five/docs/index.html) and user interface build library [React](https://reactjs.org/) implemented**like three-dimensional space player**.

:::tip
We abstract the dynamic behavior of the three-dimensional space with the concept of the drama.Traditional theatrical books mainly depict stories and shape human images, while **Vreo Theatre** focuses on the dynamic expression of three-dimensional spatial information.

The traditional drama is usually composed mainly of **words** and **stage instructions** , and similar concepts are found in **Vreo theater**.For example, the stage in the **Vreo Theatre** is to render three-dimensional spaces in which the words speak digital topics and subtitles.

**Stage instruction** refers to a descriptive description of **in the theatre** - content includes an image of the person, psychological activity, emotional change and scene, description of the atmosphere, time, location, action and requirements for artistic handling, such as lights, layouts, sound effects, etc.

In **Vreo Playbook** instead of showing stage instructions in **narrative description** , we define camera mirrors, three-dimensional effects, space actions, etc. as **play frame**.Since our original intention was a dynamic expression of three-dimensional spatial information, there would be no claims for personal image, psychological activity, emotional change, etc. Similar modules are available in three-dimensional spaces.
