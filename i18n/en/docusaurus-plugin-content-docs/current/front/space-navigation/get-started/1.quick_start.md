## Create Live Instance

You need to create a three-dimensional space before using the player, that is, `Five` instance:

```ts
import * as React from 'react'
import { Five } from '@realsee/five'

const five = new Five({
    /* Five configuration */
})
```

:::tip
You can go to [**like the three-dimensional space fast practice document**](../../3d-space/get-started/usage/00.space.md) learn `Five` about the creation and use of instances.
:::

## Create `Player` instance

When creating an instance of `Player` you need to pass the `Five` instance to constructor as initial parameter `Player`.

```ts
import { Player } from '@realsee/vreo'

const vreoPlayer = new Player(five) // where five were created for the previous step
```

Of course, you also need to introduce the `default` style into your own project, otherwise some UI effects cannot be displayed correctly：

```css
@import '@realsee/vreo/stylesheets/default.css';
```

## Load theater data

Load the script data：for the player through the `load` method

```ts
// Asynchronous Request Theatre Data
const vreoUnit = await Fetch('api/**/**')

// Load Station Data
// Highlight-start
vrePlayer.load(vreoUnit)
// Highlight-end
```

## Pause & playback

By default, data will be played automatically once it is loaded.You can pause playback by `pause()` method, you can also resume playback by `play()` method：

```ts
// Pause script
vreoPlayer.pause()

// Play script
vreoPlayer.play()
```

## Panel Control

**Vreo** will come with a bottom panel, inscription barrage, digital human images, etc. are displayed on this panel, you can control the panel by `show()`,`hide()` methods：

```ts
// Hide panel
vrePlayer.hide()

// Display panel
vreoPlayer.show()
```


:::tip
To this end, you have used **Vreo** the most core of the player.
:::

## Event listener

You can listen to related events through the `on()` method.

```ts
// Listen to play events
vreoPlayer.on ("playing", callback)

// Listen to pause events
vreoPlayer.on ("paused", callback)
```
